Based in the heart of the inner-west at Petersham, we are a boutique photography studio featuring white, textured brick walls and two north-facing arch windows which illuminate the studio with beautiful natural light all day long.

The space is versatile, with blockout blinds fixed to the arch windows, allowing for studio lighting setups.

We are also a co-working space and event venue.&nbsp;
