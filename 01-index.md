Hi, I’m [Lyn Taylor]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/), welcome to Desk & Studio!
{: .lead }

I wanted to create a co-working space for self-employed creative types (like me). It’s a space away from home distractions with an inspiring vibe. You can collaborate with other inspiring people, or just put the headphones on and get into a work groove.

We’re based right in the heart of the inner-west at Petersham, just near Norton Street Leichardt, around the corner from caf&eacute;s and a short bus trip into Sydney.

Stepping into Desk & Studio will make you feel inspired. It’s a light, white and bright co-working space featuring a studio, conference room and a funky multi-purpose event venue.

We’re small, and we’re keeping it that way. We like knowing each other’s names and we pride ourselves on being a supportive and collaborative community.

Whatever you can think of doing with a space, we can do it! You can transform our multi-use spaces to offer workshops, product launches, project or client meetings, photo or video shoots, music launches, or the works! 

Our style is clean, modern and designed to inspire you. Why not check us out?
