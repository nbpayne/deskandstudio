Hi, I’m [Lyn Taylor]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/), welcome to Desk & Studio!
{: .lead }

We’re based right in the heart of the inner-west at Petersham, across the road from Norton Street in Leichhardt and a 
short bus trip into Sydney.

Stepping into Desk & Studio will make you feel inspired. It’s a studio filled with natural light, a clean, bright 
co-working space as well as a multi-purpose meeting room and event venue.

Our style is clean, modern and designed to inspire you. Why not check us out?
