        <h1>Creative co-working space</h1>

        <p>A co-working space for creatives. This is not just a "desk for hire" on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. This is a space created for the photographer or graphic designer (or even accountant!) working from home who needs a professional space to get out of the home office.</p>
