# Outgrown WFH[*](#WFH){: .js-nav.js-top }?

## Hire a desk, get so much more

---

I know your challenge – working from home can start to wear thin! It’s hard staying focused on your projects when the kids/cat/washing up keep intruding on your thoughts!
{: .lead }

That’s why I created Desk &amp; Studio. I wanted it to feel like a ‘work home’ away from ‘home work’.

Everyone who steps over the threshold has the same reaction: “It’s so light and bright!” Surrounded by freshly painted white brick walls, the space manages to be both welcoming and inspiring.

Every desk comes equipped with lockable drawers and filing cabinet, as well as a welcome succulent and coffee cup!

High ceilings, with a retro tiled floor, Desk &amp; Studio is a flexible space that can be used for anything from workshops to project collaboration, solo entrepreneurship, seminars and photo shoots.
