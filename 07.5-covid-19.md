We are open\! However, there are a few rules.
{: .lead}

In order to keep everyone safe we are enforcing the following:

* Upon entry, proof of vaccination or proof of medical exemption to be supplied
* All crew must wear masks and check-in upon entry
* Maximum of 15 people in your crew

If there is non-compliance during the shoot, we reserve the right to cancel on the spot with no refund.

Adjustments will be made to these entry requirements as NSW moves through the re-opening timeline through October to December. Please get in [contact](/contact/) if you have questions around this.

In the meantime we are:

* Deep cleaning the studio daily
* Keeping antibacterial hand wash available at all times
* Maintaining a record of everyone who comes into the studio to assist NSW Health with contact tracing if required
