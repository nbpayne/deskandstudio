We're still open, and it's a great time to be creating content. However, there are a few rules.
{: .lead }

In order to keep everyone safe we are enforcing the following rules:

- Maximum of 10 people in your crew
- No one on site with flu-like symptoms
- No one on site who's had contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 within the last 2 weeks
- Wash your hands!

In the meantime we're:

- Deep cleaning the studio daily
- Keeping hand wash available at all times
- Maintaining a record of everyone who comes into the studio to assist NSW Health with contact tracing if required

Please get in [contact](/contact/) if you have questions. Otherwise go ahead and [Book now](https://deskandstudio.simplybook.me/v2/#book){: target="_blank" }.
