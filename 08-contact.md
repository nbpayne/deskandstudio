Lyn Taylor is a photographer, videographer, musician, project manager, and all-round creative type.
{: .lead}

Lyn had a vision of creating a boutique creative space for the photographer, designer, small business owner and anyone looking for a dedicated workspace away from home. She wanted to design a studio space optimised for brewing great ideas, creativity and collaboration.

Lyn found the perfect space to bring her dreams to life. This funky space is located at [460A Parramatta Road, Petersham (enter from Queens Street)](https://goo.gl/maps/c41QcFGe7Gx){: target="_blank"}, in the heart of the creative inner west, minutes from the city via buses along Parramatta Road, and an easy walk to Leichardt village shops.
