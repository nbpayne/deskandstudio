# You’re in good company
        
## Join the camperdown creative collective

---

It’s a hive of creativity surrounding Desk &amp; Studio! Perfect for freelancers in creative jobs who need access to support services or simply an inspiring place to unwind or work out. Join our collective of successful creative businesses located in the Camperdown area, the heart of Sydney’s inner west.

Our open environment creates the perfect conditions to creatives to thrive in collaboration with each other. However we’re also small enough for quiet, focused work.
