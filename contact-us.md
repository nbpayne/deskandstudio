# We love succulents

## Want to know more?

Lyn Taylor is a photographer, videographer, musician, graphic designer, project manager, lover of succulents, and all-round creative type.

Lyn had a vision of creating a boutique co-working space for the portfolio creative, small business owner and anyone looking for a dedicated workspace away from home. She wanted to design a co-working space optimised for brewing great ideas, and also be a home to her growing collection of succulents! ([Did we mention every ‘deskie’ gets one?](/desk.html)).

Lyn and Allie (owner of The Newsagency) found the perfect space to bring both their dreams to life. This co-located space became home to Desk &amp; Studio and The Newsagency, Sydney’s cosiest music venue. These funky spaces are located at 74-76 Pyrmont Bridge Road, Annandale, in the heart of the creative inner west, minutes from the city via buses along Parramatta Road, and an easy walk to Annandale Village shops.

Do you want to join the Deskie Crew? If only for the donuts, beer and succulents! To arrange a tour with Lyn, or go right ahead and book today, be sure to leave your calling card below. 

No question is the wrong question ☺
