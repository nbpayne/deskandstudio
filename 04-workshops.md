#### An introduction to the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K and 6K

The Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K and 6K is an incredible digital cinema camera that can easily punch its weight against Canon cinema cameras, Red, and Arri when used correctly. There’s a lot under the hood and understanding how the BMPCC works will enable you to get the best out of it and make your post production process quick and easy.

This workshop aims to get you up and running quickly on your camera by exploring the various menu options and user interface controls and explaining how the underlying feature works. By the end of this workshop you will be able to make sensible decisions about how to configure your camera to achieve the results you’re looking for.

Included in this session will be:

- What’s the difference between Blackmagic RAW and Apple ProRes?
- What resolution should I choose and when will the sensor be “windowed”?
- Crop factor… what is it and do I have to worry about it?
- How do I shoot in slow motion and what are the gotchas?
- What’s dual native ISO and how do I decide what ISO to use?
- Customising the display and controls to make life easy
- How do I plug in different types of microphones?
- Dynamic range and LUTs -- what should I choose for shooting and for post?
- Options for media, rigs, lenses, and more
- Basic colour grading of Blackmagic RAW files in DaVinci Resolve
- Anything you want to know –- bring your questions with you

Bring with you:

- Your BMPCC 6K or 4K camera with a lens
- A couple of charged batteries or your power supply to plug in to mains power
- (Optional) A tripod if you have one to set your camera on whilst we get to know it; alternatively you can hold the camera in your hands

This workshop will be held in the office of Desk and Studio at Petersham in Sydney with a maximum of 5 participants, and will be delivered by cinematographer and BMPCC fan Nick Payne.
