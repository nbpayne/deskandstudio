Our large light-filled photo studio has been designed to be used as a natural light photography studio, but can be easily transformed for flash and continuous lighting.

We offer a wide range of options for backdrops, lighting and textures for the space on-site. You can also BYO backdrops if you have specialist requirements.

Our location is convenient and easy to find — a short drive or your choice of bus or train from Sydney CBD to Petersham — getting here and setting up is a breeze.

The studio can be hired for a full day, or just half a day, and with the option of late night photo studio hire or even weekend hires, and booking is easy via the online booking system.
