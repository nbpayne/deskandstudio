                <h2>We're open, with a few rules</h2>
                <p class="lead">We are still open for your commercial shoot needs, however there are a few rules.</p>
                <p>In order to keep everyone safe we are enforcing the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All crew must wear masks and check-in upon entry</li>
                    <li>No one on site from the Blacktown, Campbelltown, Canterbury-Bankstown, Cumberland, Fairfield, Georges River, Liverpool or Parramatta local government areas whilst these remain under tighter restrictions than Greater Sydney</li>
                    <li>Maximum of 5 people in your crew</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If there is non-compliance during the shoot, we reserve the right to cancel on the spot with no refund.</p>
                <p>In the meantime we are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deep cleaning the studio daily</li>
                    <li>Keeping antibacterial hand wash available at all times</li>
                    <li>Maintaining a record of everyone who comes into the studio to assist NSW Health with contact tracing if required</li>
                </ul>
