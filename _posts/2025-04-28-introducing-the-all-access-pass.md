From July 1st, our studio hire model is evolving.

You’ll now have the option to upgrade your booking with the new All Access Pass, giving you full use of:

- Professional lighting & modifiers
- Our curated selection of paper backdrops

Whether you're shooting fashion, beauty, or branding—this is the luxury of convenience.

Bookings from July 1 onwards can select "All Access" during checkout.

Questions? Just ask Lyn or Nick—we’re here to help.
